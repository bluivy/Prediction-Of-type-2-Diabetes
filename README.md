# Prediction-Of-type-2-Diabetes



Diabetes is a chronic disease. The type 2 diabetes is known as type 2 diabetes mellitus or the adult onset diabetes. Diabetes is characterized by high levels of blood sugar. Type 2 is more common in than Type 1 diabates.

# Explaining the project

Initially while learning ML I came across a project where the same prediction was implemented using Neural Networks. Neural networks work well if there are many features( independent variables). However there were only 8 Features. So instead of using complex algorithm, I tried to implement the same with much more simpler algorithms


# About the dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to predict whether a person has type2 diabetes or not.

CONTENTS

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# why LogisticRegression and SVM???

The dataset has 8 features and 768 entries. Since the main aim is to classify the data. It is best to implement logistic regression and SVM. The simple algorithm is sufficient to address the problem.
